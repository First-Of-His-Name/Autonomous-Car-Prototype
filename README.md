# Autonomous Car

This project uses various Deep Learning model architectures to classify the self-generated road data for building an autonomous car.

### Images
The bluetooth controlled car was driven on an indoor track and the training data was generated by taking images from a camera mounted on the car. The images were labelled manually into 4 categories:
1. Front (F)
2. Left  (L)
3. Right (R)
4. Stop  (S)
